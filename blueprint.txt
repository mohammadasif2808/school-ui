I have updated the blueprint to use JavaScript (ES6+) instead of TypeScript. The architectural logic remains the same,
  but the implementation will be simpler without the type definitions.

  Updated Migration Strategy (JavaScript Edition)

   1. Project Foundation:
       * Tooling: Vite (for fast builds) + React + JavaScript.
       * Prop Validation: Since we aren't using TypeScript, we will use PropTypes to ensure components receive the
         correct data (e.g., ensuring StatCard actually receives a number for count).

   2. Folder Structure (JS Version):

    1     src/
    2     ├── assets/             # Images, fonts
    3     ├── components/
    4     │   ├── ui/             # Button.jsx, Card.jsx, Badge.jsx
    5     │   └── layout/         # Sidebar.jsx, Header.jsx, MainLayout.jsx
    6     ├── context/            # AuthContext.jsx
    7     ├── hooks/              # useWindowSize.js
    8     ├── modules/            # Feature-based organization
    9     │   ├── dashboard/
   10     │   │   ├── components/ # Dashboard-specific widgets
   11     │   │   └── DashboardPage.jsx
   12     │   └── students/       # Student module components and pages
   13     ├── services/           # api.js (Axios instance)
   14     ├── App.jsx             # Route definitions
   15     └── main.jsx            # Entry point

   3. Development Steps:
       * Step 1: Scaffold the React app.
       * Step 2: Install essential libraries (react-router-dom for navigation, recharts for the charts seen in
         screenshots, lucide-react for icons).
       * Step 3: Create the Layout System (Sidebar + Header) that matches your screenshots exactly.
       * Step 4: Build the Dashboard with the specific widgets shown (Total Students, Quick Links, Schedules).

  Step 1: Scaffold Application

  I will now generate the React application in your current directory.

  Plan:
   1. Create a new React project named school-management-system.
   2. Install dependencies: react-router-dom (routing), lucide-react (icons), recharts (charts), prop-types
      (validation).
   3. Set up the folder structure.

  I'll start by initializing the project.
